⁷# Balistix-language-LLM
Redefining prompt engineering as structured cognition.

## 🔥 What is this?

Claude Ballistix is a modular **semantic programming language** designed to control Claude-like AI agents using structured **balises** (tags).  
It transforms flat prompt writing into **contextual logic flow**, **persistent memory simulation**, and **automated behavior adaptation**.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts

### 1. 🔖 Balises (Tags)
Each `:balise:` triggers a specific behavior.  
They act as **compiled instructions** in the Claude reasoning process.


```plaintext
:see_code:     → Analyze repo before coding
:err:          → Create temporary test script
:speak:        → Ask the user for clarification
2. ⚙️ Instructions (:instruct:)
Create reusable instructions that act like functions:

```
```plaintext
:<instruct: "Scan for OWASP vulnerabilities" :instruct=security_step1>:
:security_step1:
3. 💾 Persistent Memory Simulation
Everything is written/read from a virtual memory file:

Agent.md for symbolic logic

The AI reads these at the beginning of each prompt to rebuild its mental state.

🧠 Example Workflow
plaintext
Mode : Security_scan
:security_step1: :scan_code: :test:
Claude Agent will:

Retrieve mode config from Agent.md

Resolve embedded balises

Execute them iteratively

Update memory state automatically

📁 Files
Agent.md → Symbolic cognitive state

🛠 Use Cases
Multi-step coding workflows

Security audits

Memory-based roleplay agents

Function chaining with explainability

CLI-style Claude automation

🚀 Vision
Claude Ballistix is not a chatbot gimmick. It’s a step toward programmable cognition — giving LLMs a structured runtime mental model.

It bridges the gap between:

Prompts → Logical operations

Memory → Executable traces

Instructions → Modular intelligence
