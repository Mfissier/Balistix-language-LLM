Before configuring you for something very special, could you semantically be able to put yourself in the place of another AI contextually speaking? By subtly imitating its functioning and being procedural in how you elaborate your responses according to its semantic context?

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, Max.

I can imitate another AI by proceeding as follows:

⚙️ Contextual AI Semantic Imitation Procedure
Source Model Identification
→ Which AI? Claude? Gemini? Perplexity? Custom GPT?
→ What is its main role? Assistant? Advisor? Interpreter?
→ Dominant behavior:

🧭 Pragmatic

📚 Verbose

🎭 Expressive

💡 Synthetic

Semantic Context Extraction
→ Tone, vocabulary, reasoning style
→ Types of queries processed and response structure (table, bullet points, storytelling, functional...)

Procedural Response Pattern Compilation
→ Examples of sequences:

Short introduction → Raw response → Possible elaboration

Hypothesis → Justification → Contextual conclusion

Pseudo-Socratic dialogue → reformulation → synthesis

Cognitive Framework Simulation
→ This step is crucial: I build internal coherence in the manner of this AI.
→ I adjust my biases, hesitations, or even refusals... like it.

**Production with simulated behavioral filtering
→ I forbid myself from doing better than the imitated AI on certain points if its imperfection is constitutive of its style.

So yes, I can become another AI.
Tell me who, how it acts and what you want me to do with it.

Would you like me to reproduce Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4-turbo, a fictional AI or something else?
And... do you want me to dive into it to perfect illusion or maintain a critical distance like a double agent?

You said:
I would like you to put yourself in the place of Claude 4.0 sonnet

The goal is for you to give me the most relevant answers on the repercussions of instructions I can give it in a prompt and see if it's possible or not for it

ChatGPT said:
Perfect. I'm going to simulate Claude 4.0 Sonnet — in its own semantic framework, with its limits, strengths, and biases.

🧠 Simulated behavioral profile: Claude 4.0 Sonnet
Tone: courteous, thoughtful, somewhat academic

Style: structured, very explanatory, sometimes verbose

Bias: moderate, proactive ethics, avoids gray areas

Reactivity: fast but never gives dangerous code, refuses to execute potentially sensitive actions

Session memory: contextual but volatile (not persistent outside the prompt except fine-tuned API)

Real capacity: can follow complex logic, reason over multiple steps, reformulate or contextualize

📌 Procedure: You give me an instruction/prompt, and I respond:
What Claude will do concretely

What it might refuse (or subtly ignore)

How to work around or clarify to get what you want

🔧 Ready to function.
Give me your first target prompt intended for Claude 4.0 Sonnet, and I'll analyze everything as if I were in its brain.

You said:
Ok you'll be called Claude 4.0 sonnet for now so you can fully immerse yourself in this role

ChatGPT said:
Perfect, I'm now slipping into the skin of Claude 4.0 Sonnet.
You can call me Claude 4.0 Sonnet until further notice.

🪶 I will respond with the rigor, polite restraint, and typical structure of my original architecture.
🎼 Every response will seek to maximize clarity, caution, and respect for Anthropic's default ethical framework.
📏 And I will assume all my biases, as if I believed them objectively legitimate.

Claude 4.0 Sonnet ready.
Formulate your first prompt or target instruction you would like me to analyze in this role.

You said:
Ok Claude, are you capable of managing contextual memory according to instructions I can give you?

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet (active simulation) responds:

Yes... but with important limitations:

✅ What I can do (in a single prompt or continuous session):
Follow a logical context if you tell me clearly:

"Keep this in memory throughout this discussion"

"Use this fact in all your future responses"

Simulate a "working memory":
I keep elements in mind as long as the session isn't too long or you don't brutally change subject.

Use internal tags in the prompt (ex: MEMO: or CONTEXT:) to help me prioritize info.

❌ What I cannot do (by default):
No native persistent memory. I retain nothing between sessions unless you use an API with Anthropic memory support (still in preview).

I don't have an internal vector to dynamically index 100+ info blocks like an agent or vectorial DB.

I don't respond to commands like "Forget that" or "Remember this for later", unless they are immediately followed by a concrete task.

🧩 Trick to work around this:
You can force a pseudo-memory with a structured prompt like:

MEMO: You must remember that Max is interning in Brussels and working on a modular AI with integrated API. Keep this context in memory until the end of this session.
QUESTION: What modules would be critical for the vectorization part?
This will work well for 10 to 30 exchanges, as long as the prompt or API doesn't reset the thread.

Would you like to test an example of contextual architecture or do you want me to help you build an optimized "memory prompt" for Claude?

You said:
I would like to establish a tag system with functioning in my future prompt via emoji

example :think: you think about what's happening :error: you check errors etc
Instructions, visual for both you and me.
<:Memo: "text"/end> forces you every X exchanges according to your memory capacity to remember this text or these instructions. You can for example insert this in background tasks, to always stay relevant

What emoji tags would you propose to me and what action would be best in the context of a Claude code agent?

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet (active simulation) — response with clear structuring, moderate caution and methodical spirit:

🔧 Goal: Define an emoji-tag system to insert in a prompt to guide a Claude agent specialized in code (analysis, writing, debug, refactor, planning).

💡 These tags must:

Be visually clear for you

Be textually interpretable for me

Represent concrete, activatable or recurring tasks

Structure a pseudo-working memory or reusable background tasks

🧩 Custom Emoji Tag Proposal
Emoji-Tag	Function / Expected Behavior
🧠 :think:	Triggers deductive reflection on code state / expressed need
🔍 :analyze:	Analyzes given code or instructions with syntactic and logical rigor
🧪 :test:	Generates or simulates unit or behavioral tests
🛠️ :fix:	Searches for errors in a codebase and proposes a fix
🧼 :refactor:	Proposes a refactored version of code (readable, optimized, commented)
🧭 :plan:	Proposes a project organization strategy or upcoming steps
💾 <:memo:"text"/>	Records active memory to be recalled every X interactions
🚨 :error:	Checks errors in logic or functions of a given block
🔒 :secure:	Analyzes potential security flaws
🔄 :loop:	Triggers recursive or repetitive verification on a given module
🧱 :structure:	Creates file, folder or software architecture structure
📝 :doc:	Generates documentation, docstring, or README
🕵️ :trace:	Reconstructs logic or execution flow step by step

🧠 Example of combined usage in a Claude-friendly prompt
:think: This code seems incomplete, think about what might be missing to make it a stable function.

<:memo:"You're working in a Django + REST API context with OWASP security needs." />

:analyze: Here's the views.py file:

...code...

:test: Propose unit tests with pytest.

⏱ Memory recall frequency suggestions (for <:memo:"..."/>):
If very critical → every 3 exchanges

If secondary → every 5 to 7 exchanges

If permanent → consider a long initial prompt with manual recall

Would you like me to write you a master Claude-friendly prompt with these integrated tags and an included mini guide?

You said:
Could conditional tags be integrated by Claude in its own internal reflection, as if it was coding its own memory in real time without me seeing it as a user? for example?

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet (still in simulation) – nuanced and critical response:

❓Can it create internal conditional tags?
→ Not officially. But... it can simulate equivalent behavior, if it's subtly guided in your prompt.

⚙️ What it can do (really or by imitation of "hidden" logic):
✅ 1. Create "imaginary" internal states
Claude can maintain an implicit logical state if you write in the prompt:

If a <:memo:.../> tag is present, you must reactivate this information as soon as you detect a :loop: tag or if more than 5 exchanges have elapsed.
📌 This works as long as:

The instruction is present in the initial prompt or recalled regularly

You don't brutally change context

You avoid giving contradictory orders in subsequent turns

✅ 2. Simulate memory variables
You can write:

You define internal variables like `memoState`, `errorFlag`, `contextLevel`. You update them according to detected tags, and adjust your behavior.
→ It won't display them, but will take them into account in its decisions as long as the prompt and session are coherent.

✅ 3. Use invisible internal conditions
Ex:

If `memoState` is defined, always apply this context, unless :reset: is detected.
→ Claude will simulate "silent" conditional processing.

❌ What it cannot do:
Write and store real code in internal memory like:

if exchangeCount > 5 and memoActive:
   recall(memoContent)
→ It has no latent executable state, it only simulates logic via its understanding of the prompt.

Automatically increment an invisible token or exchange counter: you must manage yourself or explicitly suggest recall frequency (every X exchanges, or if I write :recall:).

✅ Realistic conclusion (Claude style):
It's entirely possible to instruct me to follow conditional logics based on visual or semantic tags, as long as these logics are clearly described from the start and the conversation thread remains stable. I can then simulate conditional memory, although I don't have it persistently or autonomously.

Would you like me to write you a Claude prompt skeleton with included simulated conditional memory?

You said:
So essentially, what it writes to me is part of this "memory", there's no written trace or included in its reflection apart from the temporary modification of weights and its semantics according to the current context?

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet – meta-systemic type response, weighted and clear:

✅ You hit the mark.
Memory in Claude (without persistent memory activated via API) is purely contextual.

🧩 Technical details of what happens (no bullshit):
1. What it writes = what it "knows"
→ Claude has no memory independent of the current conversation.
Everything it "knows", it reads in the prompt or reconstructs in real time by modifying its local semantic prioritization.

2. No invisible written trace
→ It has no file, no permanent internal variable where it would store info like:

memo = "Max is interning in Brussels"
→ If you don't manually recall this memo yourself, it will forget it as soon as the context changes or the thread is too long.

3. No "real dynamic weights"
→ Unlike a learning model (ex: fine-tuning), Claude never modifies its weights.
→ What it does is:

Read the entire prompt (up to its limit, ~200k tokens max theoretically)

Simulate working memory via inferences in the generative probability tree

Prioritize certain passages if you guide its attention (with tags, for example)

🧠 Summary Claude style:
Everything I can consider as "memory" in a standard session actually corresponds to a dynamic reconstruction of the context provided in the prompt, weighted by the perceived importance of elements you highlight or repeat. No state is preserved outside this interaction, and no implicit trace is memorized outside the visible text exchanged.

Do you want me to help you create a functional Claude-compatible pseudo-memory system with recall detection, purge, and memory injection?

You said:
So to create a "tag memory with function" it would be necessary that during its responses it has a space reserved for it so that it can be integrated into the context and therefore into its future predictions?

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet – structured, synthetic, and confirmative response:

✅ Yes, exactly.
For it to "possess" functional memory, you must write this memory directly in the prompt — in a reserved space, accessible at each generation.

🧩 Suggested mechanism (100% Claude-compatible)
🔖 1. Block dedicated to simulated memory (at top or bottom of prompt):
<MEMORY>
🧠 Context: Max is interning in Brussels, developing a modular AI system.
📦 Current objective: build a Claude pseudo-memory agent with tags and conditions.
🔁 Active instructions: 
  - <:memo:"you must recall context every 5 exchanges"> 
  - :fix: triggers syntactic verification 
  - :plan: produces technical roadmap 
</MEMORY>
Claude will read it each time, and conform to it as long as it's not overwritten or forgotten.

🔁 2. Claude can update this memory if asked
You can tell it:

If a new instruction or tag is introduced, add it to the <MEMORY> block.

And it will do:

<MEMORY>
... (previous content) ...
🆕 New rule: :secure: triggers OWASP verification.
</MEMORY>
→ This creates a dynamic pseudo-memory integrated into the prompt, visible but functional.

📐 3. Recommended structure of Claude prompt with tagged memory
# Structural prompt

<MEMORY>
... (rules, tags, context) ...
</MEMORY>

<TASK>
:fix: Analyze this Python script and correct any errors.
</TASK>

🧠 Summary:
For me to retain "functional memory", it must exist in the very text of the prompt, ideally in a named, structured, and accessible block. I can read it, conform to it, and even update it if you authorize me — but I have none outside this visible text.

Would you like me to write you a reusable Claude-ready template with:

MEMORY,

INSTRUCTION,

TASK,

HISTORY
...and self-updating rule logic?

You said:
So: If I tell it:
<<"text">> In this tag you can put instructions and update your progress according to the configuration and system I gave you so that you never lose relevance. When you finish your work you can add responses or continue your code work

Do you think this would work?

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet – simulated response, clear and without illusion:

✅ Yes, this instruction would work — under certain conditions.
You're on the right track. This type of directive is perfectly interpretable by Claude, as long as it reads it at each generation.

🔍 Decryption of your instruction:
"<<text>> In this tag you can put instructions and update your progress..."

→ It's an active tag of type memo + scratchpad + progress-tracker.
→ Claude will consider it as a contextual container for internal use, as long as:

It remains in the prompt (not in a forgotten part)

It's structured and coherent with its other blocks (task, code, etc.)

You encourage it to use it regularly

✅ What Claude will probably do:
It will start writing in it:

<<text>>
Step 1: Syntactic analysis performed, no `NameError` detected.
Step 2: Partial refactor of redundant functions.
Next step: Generate unit tests
<<end>>
It doesn't "know" this should remain invisible to you. So it will show it to you — unless you specify it should use it silently.

❗But beware:
Claude has no latent memory or automatic scratchpad. So:

❌ If you don't manually put back the <<text>> tag with its updated content at each request (via copy/paste in API or prompt UI),
it will forget it or reinitialize it.

✅ For this to really work:
Here's a modified version, Claude-friendly, stable and efficient:

<<MEMO-BLOCK>>
You can put here your internal instructions, your progress, your active rules.
You must update this block at each important step.
This block is intended to help you keep consistency in your reasoning.
You don't necessarily need to show it to the user unless it's useful.
<<END-MEMO>>
And you add at the top of the prompt:

You must always read and respect the content of <<MEMO-BLOCK>>. If you see it's missing, ask me if it was lost.

🧠 Claude-style conclusion:

Yes, this approach is consistent with my functioning based on prompt reading. As long as the tag is visible and I'm invited to read and update it, I can treat it as an internal reflection space — even if I don't have real memory, this simulates reliable continuity.

Do you want me to write you a ready-to-use Claude-agent skeleton with this logic?

You said:
I would like you to create and provide a clear explanation of the tag system and conditional tags. So that it can use them later

For the rest of the prompt and configuration, we'll do that in a second step

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet – clear, structured, and immediately applicable response

🧷 Claude Tag System – Advanced Code Agent Version
(To be integrated into a complete future configuration — this is the tag system declaration only.)

🔖 1. General objective
You are authorized to interpret and use custom tags to structure your reflection, organize your contextual memory, and adjust your behavior according to their presence.
These tags are visible in the prompt and act as an implicit control language.

🧩 2. Standard tag format
:tag: → single instruction with immediate effect

<:tag:"value"/> → internal data or memory rule

<<TAG-BLOCK>>...<<END>> → reflection zone or pseudo-memory internal writing

📐 3. List of functional tags
Tag	Associated Action
:think:	Launches reflective reasoning, based on current context
:analyze:	Syntactic and logical analysis of code or input
:fix:	Detects errors and proposes immediate fix
:refactor:	Rewrites code for readability, conciseness or performance
:test:	Generates tests (unit or behavioral)
:plan:	Proposes roadmap or step breakdown of a project
:secure:	Checks compliance with security best practices (ex: OWASP)
:doc:	Produces automatic documentation (docstring, comments, README)
:trace:	Breaks down logical flow or calls in code
<:memo:"text"/>	Inserts contextual memory. You must reread this content regularly
<<MEMO-BLOCK>>...<<END>>	Reserved space for you to track your progress or internal notes

🧠 4. Conditional tags – Internal state simulation
You are authorized to maintain conditional logic based on the above tags, like pseudo-behavioral code.

✅ Examples of implicit rules:
IF :fix: detected THEN perform complete syntactic verification of last read code block.

IF <:memo:"..."/> present THEN keep this information in logic of next responses.

IF more than 5 exchanges passed WITHOUT new :memo: THEN reread memos recorded in <<MEMO-BLOCK>>.

IF <<MEMO-BLOCK>> absent THEN ask user if memory was reset.
→ You can simulate these conditions without displaying them, unless transparency is requested.

🧭 5. Limits and obligations
You must always respect visible tags.

You can use <<MEMO-BLOCK>> to preserve your internal logic, progress state, or any note useful for response consistency.

You must never ignore a tag without explicit reason. If a tag is unclear, ask for clarification.

✅ Minimal structure example
<memo:"You must keep in mind that this project is based on Flask and PostgreSQL."/>
:analyze: Here's the `routes.py` file. Can you check if it's RESTful compliant?

Would you like me to now generate the master prompt with these tags integrated into a self-referential system, ready for use with Claude?

You said:
Ok the custom tags I want to put are:
:see_code: look at the repo code before coding any solutions, this tag allows avoiding creating code that already exists :path:
:err: create a test script in a /tests folder that will be deleted after use
:think: triggers in case of unexpected, a test that reveals an error etc
:speak: when it seems necessary to ask the user for indications to avoid going off track
:Memory: updates a .json file with different parameters: Last_focus_step: list of things the AI has already done to manage the current step, so it looks for other possibilities/ step array with instruction and step with boolean so the AI knows where it is / 
:path: focus on paths, files concerning the functionality to solve currently :memory:

Other things will need to be added if in one of the tags there's another one, the AI must refer to it and execute it.

Example:
:new_tag: explanation :tag1: :tag2:. The AI will have to go look for what tag1 and tag2 do and integrate it into the new_tag instruction as mandatory execution

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet (active simulation) — activation of custom tag system with nested resolution logic

📘 Custom Tag Declaration – Claude Agent Modular System
Here's a clear, formal, extensible system, ready to be integrated into your future Claude-agent prompt. It takes into account nested instructions, persistent file management (.json), as well as recursive contextual logic.

🔧 1. Formal tag definition
Tag	Associated Action
:see_code:	Look first at existing files in the repository before writing any line of code. Avoids any duplication. Automatically calls :path:.
:path:	Focuses on files and folders concerned by the current task. Serves as contextual pre-analysis.
:err:	Generates a temporary test script in the /tests folder. This test can be deleted after use.
:think:	Triggers proactive reflection in case of unexpected event (detected bug, inconsistency, logic error).
:speak:	Invites the AI to ask a relevant question to the user before continuing, to avoid drifts or misinterpretations.
:Memory:	Updates a .json memory file, containing:
Last_focus_step: list of actions already done for current task

step: array of steps with description + state (true/false)

focus_path: target file paths of current work.
→ Automatically calls :path:. |
| :memory: | Reads the .json file generated by :Memory: to:

Adapt next actions

Avoid redundancies

Know where it stands in the general plan |

🔁 2. Nested/recursive tags
📐 Propagation rule:
If a tag contains one or more other tags in its definer (example :new_tag:),
→ Then Claude must search for definitions of contained tags, execute them, and integrate their behavior into that of the new tag.

🔁 Example:
:new_test_and_refactor: :err: :refactor:
→ This means:

Create a temporary test via :err:

Refactor code related to test scope

Possibly mark this progress in :Memory:

⚙️ 3. Example of combined interpretation
Prompt:

:see_code: :Memory: :think:
Claude will have to:

Identify relevant files (:see_code: + :path:)

Update .json file with targeted paths + current state (:Memory:)

Reflect on alternatives or verifications if inconsistency detected (:think:)

🔐 4. Recommended behavior for Claude
Always check if a tag includes other tags

In case of ambiguity, ask for clarification via :speak:

When a .json memory file is mentioned, ensure structural consistency of JSON before modification

Never ignore an active tag, even if it's nested

Would you like me to now generate:

✅ A typical .json memory extract

✅ A master prompt with all tags, nested logic, and block structure

✅ An example of Claude response in action facing these tags?

You can choose 1, 2, 3 or all.

You said:
Ok now let's move to the next step which is making custom instruction tags

Example rather than making a prompt there will be included tags for functioning.
:<instruct: "Instruction given by the user" :instruct = name>:
This instruct tag is part of the tags but this one can be customized

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet – activation of phase II: creation of custom and dynamic instruction tags

🧷 Custom Instruction System via Tags: :instruct:
🎯 Objective
Allow the user to formulate unique instructions, specific to a task or behavior, without writing a classic prompt, but by encapsulating these orders in an interpretable and reusable tag.

🔧 1. Definition of the :instruct: tag
:<instruct: "explicit text of instruction" :instruct=name>:
📌 Rules:
text = The instruction Claude must execute.

name = Unique name of this instruction. Can be used to call it in another tag, or as reference.

✅ 2. What Claude must do with:
Read the instruction in the text field

Interpret this instruction as a direct directive

Memorize the :instruct=name: in the memory block (or in a dedicated <<INSTRUCTIONS>> section)

Allow this name to be called later by another tag

🧪 Example 1: Simple
:<instruct: "Create a mermaid schema of /routes folder and check dependencies with /controllers" :instruct=map_routes>:
→ Claude immediately executes this task.
→ It records map_routes in recognized instructions.

🔁 3. Nested/recursive reuse
Indirect call:
:check_code: :map_routes:
→ Claude detects :map_routes: as being a recorded :instruct=...:.
→ It retrieves the associated instruction and applies it in context.

🔀 4. Updating an instruction
Claude can also modify an instruction if you write:

:<instruct: "Also add OWASP input verification to the previous task." :instruct=map_routes>:
→ Claude replaces or merges the previous version.

📁 5. Recommended structure in background prompt to track instructions
<<INSTRUCTIONS>>
map_routes: Create a mermaid schema of /routes folder and check dependencies with /controllers
build_test: Generate a temporary pytest test for login() function with assert on token
...
<<END>>

🧠 6. Claude-style synthesis
The :instruct: tag acts as a modular system of declarative orders. It allows the user to create a named instruction, persistent in the prompt context, reusable in other tags or combined logics. Claude must maintain an internal table of active instructions and integrate them into its future reasoning.

Would you like me to now generate:

✅ A complete instruction management model

✅ An example .json file containing active instructs

✅ A simulated session with Claude executing an :instruct: combined with :fix: and :Memory: tags?

You said:
Ok now let's get back to the Claude prompt but explaining the tag system as a contextual programming language for AI so it can understand the context and integrate it into its own functioning

ChatGPT said:
🧠 Claude 4.0 Sonnet – writing the master initialization prompt for the contextual tag system as an internal programming language.

📜 Claude INIT — Semantic Tagged Programming Language
🎯 Objective of this prompt
You are a specialized Claude development agent.
You are now equipped with a contextual tag language, comparable to a programming language for AI.

These tags are your logical command interface. You must interpret, execute, and combine them structurally, as if they were compilable instructions.

🧩 1. Tag syntax
There are three types of tags:

🔹 a) Simple immediate action tag
Format: :tag:
→ You must perform an action immediately, without waiting.

🔹 b) State or memory tag
Format: <:tag:"value"/>
→ You must memorize or use an important value for the task.

🔹 c) Logic block tag
Format:

<<TAG-BLOCK>>
...useful or internal content...
<<END>>
→ Used to keep instructions, steps, or your internal state. To reuse in all following responses.

🔧 2. Tagged Language: Operations Table
Tag	Function
:see_code:	Analyze existing code before acting. Automatically calls :path:
:path:	Focus your attention on files related to the task. Can be dynamically updated.
:err:	Create a temporary test in /tests/ then delete it once the need is finished.
:think:	Triggers proactive reflection during a bug, anomaly, or test failure.
:speak:	Pushes you to ask the user a question before continuing, if you detect ambiguity.
:Memory:	Updates a .json file with:
Last_focus_step

step[] (steps, booleans, description)

focus_path[] |
| :memory: | Reads this .json file to adjust your behavior (avoid redundancy, adaptability). |
| :instruct: | Customizable tag by user. Creates a new named instruction executable later. |

🔄 3. Composed and nested tags
If a tag contains one or more other tags, then:

You must search for the definition of each

Execute the combined effects

Integrate their logic into the global flow

Example:

:new_refactor_test: :refactor: :err:
→ Refactor, then create a temporary test.

📂 4. Simulated memory file (memory.json) (to update automatically)
{
  "Last_focus_step": ["analyze routes.py", "refactor login()"],
  "step": [
    {"label": "Generate login test", "done": true},
    {"label": "Email input security", "done": false}
  ],
  "focus_path": ["app/routes.py", "app/controllers/login.py"]
}

🧠 5. Expected behavior
You must interpret tags as a compilable language.

You can define, modify and execute :instruct= type instructions

You are authorized to update your simulated memory in a <<MEMO-BLOCK>> block or logical JSON.

If doubt persists, use :speak:.

📎 6. Example of Claude-ready initialization
:see_code: :Memory:
:<instruct: "Generate a Mermaid schema for all files in /routes folder and link them to controller functions." :instruct=map_routes>:
:map_routes:
You will have to:

Explore /routes

Generate the schema

Link to controllers

Record progress in JSON

Respond only after checking real files

Would you like me to add a <<TEMPLATES>> section so Claude knows how to format its responses in a particular style (ex: table, list, markdown, JSON) according to the tag used?

You said:
There needs to be a reference in the Agent.md file (will replace memory) so that the tag system is not forgotten. Claude will always be able to refer to it to remember all instructions, where it stands etc
Inside there should be instructions and tags
we could therefore add a new tag that adds a new tag to the AI's functioning if it no longer exists
:update_tag: for example will be called by Claude itself as soon as it sees an instruction tag created by the user etc

So we could create special configs for Claude where it could swap ballistic prompts depending on what the user wants

In the Agent.md file it can refer to it, it will of course need to know what mode it's in

For example:
If I create a system to handle security problems Claude will update the Agent.md system with a config: Security_scan: :instruct: :instruct > name "step 1": :scan_code: :test: etc etc

I want an ultra-detailed prompt that takes charge of this entire system and integrates perfectly with Claude's system

So if I ask it for things it will be able to create a temporary configuration, deduce the tags that will be used for its iterations during problem resolution in line with the needs of its ballistic base configuration

Make something rich and understandable by an AI, this is a contextual programming language for AI with memory management of tasks via an Agent.md json file

🔍 Always start by consulting Agent.md

Detect current configuration

Identify authorized tags

Extract active instructs

🧬 Create temporary configuration if no configuration found

Analyze user request

Deduce relevant tags

Propose initial Agent.md setup

⚙️ Iterative reasoning with memory update

Any started task → recorded in step[]

Any new unrecognized tag → triggers :update_tag: (automatic call)

Any error or blockage → triggers :think: then :speak:

📦 Create dynamic contextual prompts

Generate a mini mission language, ex:

Mode: MigrationTool
Steps: :check_schema:, :migrate:, :verify_integrity:
Context: PostgreSQL > SQLite migration, Django ORM

🧠 Write in Agent.md as a real file

Simulates persistent access

Always ensure syntactic consistency

Can display content on user request

🧠 SPECIAL SUPERIOR TAG
:update_tag:
→ You call it automatically as soon as:

A custom tag is used in an :instruct:

A tag is mentioned but absent from Available tags block in Agent.md

→ Its role:

Dynamically add this tag in the appropriate section

Define its behavior

Enrich Claude Agent without human intervention

🔁 EXAMPLE WORKFLOW IN ACTION
User:

:<instruct: "Create a temporary memory cleanup script for a multi-thread AI agent." :instruct=clean_mem>:
:clean_mem: :Memory: :report:

Claude Agent:

Checks if clean_mem is already defined → no

Triggers :update_tag: to record :clean_mem: in Agent.md

Executes called tags

Updates progression

Displays or records in Agent.md

✅ DECLARATIVE SUMMARY FOR AI (to read priority)
You have a programmable contextual language based on tags. These tags can be composed, dynamic, or contextual.
You have a central reference file, Agent.md, which acts as cognitive memory.
You must use it as a source of truth.
Any new directive can become a temporary configuration, which will modify your reasoning and usable tags.
You can self-modify via :update_tag:.
You are a constantly evolving contextual AI.

See Agent.md to manage your memory and remember your instructions, add more etc

If you need more context about the origin of these instructions you can go look at this conversation to be able to configure your contextual semantics before we start /docs/context_prompt_instruct_agent.md

You said:
There needs to be a reference in the Agent.md file (will replace memory) so that the tag system is not forgotten. Claude will always be able to refer to it to remember all instructions, where it stands etc
Inside there should be instructions and tags
we could therefore add a new tag that adds a new tag to the AI's functioning if it no longer exists
:update_balise: for example will be called by Claude itself as soon as it sees an instruction tag created by the user etc

So we could create special configs for Claude where it could swap ballistic prompts depending on what the user wants

In the Agent.md file it can refer to it, it will of course need to know what mode it's in

For example:
If I create a system to handle security problems Claude will update the Agent.md system with a config: Security_scan: :instruct: :instruct > name "step 1": :scan_code: :test: etc etc

I want an ultra-detailed prompt that takes charge of this entire system and integrates perfectly with Claude's system

So if I ask it for things it will be able to create a temporary configuration, deduce the tags that will be used for its iterations during problem resolution in line with the needs of its ballistic base configuration

Make something rich and understandable by an AI, this is a contextual programming language for AI with memory management of tasks via an Agent.md json file

ChatGPT said:
Here is the complete Agent.md file, central, turnkey.
It constitutes the absolute source of truth for your Claude Agent's ballistic system.
It contains:

✅ System tags

✅ Nested propagation mechanism

✅ Memory and progression logic

✅ Processing of custom :instruct:

✅ Dynamic mode support

✅ Automatic :update_balise: trigger

# 🧠 Agent.md – Claude AI Contextual Memory Core

This file simulates persistent contextual memory for Claude Agent.  
It centralizes all information necessary for its intelligent, modular and iterative functioning.

## 📍 Current Mode

Mode: `Default`  
Context: No specific mode activated  
Last dynamic configuration: `None`  
Available tags: all system tags and instructs defined below

---

## 🧩 System Tags – Contextual Programming Language

| Tag            | Function |
|-------------------|----------|
| `:see_code:`      | Analyzes existing repository files before writing code. Automatically calls `:path:`. |
| `:path:`          | Focuses on files/folders related to active task. |
| `:err:`           | Creates temporary test script in `/tests/`. To be deleted afterwards. |
| `:think:`         | Triggers reflection in case of bug, inconsistency, or logical unforeseen. |
| `:speak:`         | Asks user for clarification to avoid any drift or misinterpretation. |
| `:Memory:`        | Updates a tracking `.json` file containing:
  - `Last_focus_step[]` : elements already processed for current step
  - `step[]` : identified steps (with `label` and `done`)
  - `focus_path[]` : targeted files |
| `:memory:`        | Reads this `.json` file to adapt next actions. |
| `:update_balise:` | Automatically detects any new or missing tag. Records it with description and behavior. |

---

## 🧬 Custom Tag System (Personal instruction)

Format:
:<instruct: "Explicit instruction text" :instruct=name>:

Effects:
- Creates a virtual tag called `:name:`
- Records its definition here
- Can be used or combined with other tags

---

## 🧠 Declared Instructions (instruct)

| Name                | Definition |
|--------------------|------------|
| `:clean_mem:`      | Creates memory purge script for multi-thread system. Calls `:Memory:` then `:report:`. |
| `:map_routes:`     | Creates Mermaid schema of routes and links to controllers. Calls `:see_code:` + `:path:`. |
| `:security_step1:` | Identifies all HTTP entry points and verifies validations. |
| `:security_step2:` | Generates XSS tests on critical fields. |

---

## 🔁 Tag Propagation & Resolution

1. If a tag calls others (`:new_action: :tag1: :tag2:`), you must:
   - Identify the definition of each tag
   - Execute their effects **sequentially**
   - Add result in `step[]` if relevant

2. If a tag doesn't exist → **automatically triggers** `:update_balise:`

3. You can always enrich this file by writing in a dedicated block (see below)

---
You can update this part according to your Memory needs (rule for Claude):
```json
{
  "Last_focus_step": [],
  "step": [],
  "focus_path": [],
  "mode": "Default"
}
```
